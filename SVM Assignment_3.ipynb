    "Q1. In order to predict house price based on several characteristics, such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., you are developing an SVM regression model. Which regression metric in this situation would be the best to employ?\n",
    "\n",
    "For predicting house prices with an SVM regression model, Mean Squared Error (MSE) would be a suitable regression metric. MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual house prices, providing a comprehensive assessment of the model's accuracy. Lower MSE values indicate better predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use MSE for evaluating an SVM regression model in Python:\n",

    "Copy code\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVR\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the dataset (replace 'path_to_dataset' with the actual path)\n",
    "data_path = 'path_to_dataset'\n",
    "house_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming 'target' is the column representing house prices\n",
    "X = house_data.drop('target', axis=1)\n",
    "y = house_data['target']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split the dataset into training and testing sets\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create and train the SVM regression model\n",
    "svm_regressor = SVR(kernel='linear')  # You can choose an appropriate kernel\n",
    "svm_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make predictions on the test set\n",
    "y_pred = svm_regressor.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate Mean Squared Error\n",
    "mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}')\n",
    "Q2. You have built an SVM regression model and are trying to decide between using MSE or R-squared as your evaluation metric. Which metric would be more appropriate if your goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "If your goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, Mean Squared Error (MSE) would be more appropriate. MSE directly measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, providing a detailed assessment of the prediction accuracy. Minimizing MSE leads to more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared, while informative about the proportion of variance explained by the model, may not provide the same granular insight into prediction accuracy as MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. You have a dataset with a significant number of outliers and are trying to select an appropriate regression metric to use with your SVM model. Which metric would be the most appropriate in this scenario?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the presence of outliers, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) might be more appropriate than MSE. MSE tends to be sensitive to outliers because it squares the differences between predicted and actual values. On the other hand, MAE takes the absolute values of these differences, making it more robust to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use MAE for evaluating an SVM regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming 'target' is the column representing house prices\n",
    "# ...\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make predictions on the test set\n",
    "y_pred = svm_regressor.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate Mean Absolute Error\n",
    "mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae:.2f}')\n",
    "Q4. You have built an SVM regression model using a polynomial kernel and are trying to select the best metric to evaluate its performance. You have calculated both MSE and RMSE and found that both values are very close. Which metric should you choose to use in this case?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, choosing between MSE and RMSE depends on your preference and interpretation. Since both values are very close, the choice might not significantly impact the assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE gives more weight to larger errors due to squaring, while RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) takes the square root of MSE, providing a metric in the same unit as the target variable. If the scale of your target variable is important for interpretation, you might prefer RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming 'target' is the column representing house prices\n",

Which metric would be most appropriate if your goal is to measure how well the model explains the variance in the target variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "When your goal is to measure how well the model explains the variance in the target variable, R-squared (Coefficient of Determination) is the most appropriate metric. R-squared provides an indication of the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n",
